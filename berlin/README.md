This is a map of Berlin's exclaves on the border of West and East Germany (from 1949; some ended in 1971, others persisted until 1988 or reunification),

- Wikipedia (DE): https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/West-Berlin#Exklaven,_die_zum_Stadtgebiet_von_West-Berlin_geh%C3%B6rten

Creating an accurate map today is difficult because smaller exclaves are not visible on a full city-scale map; some were unpopulated or ignored.
It is easier to map areas which include part of the current Berlin city border (such as Eiskeller).

Detailed exclaves (particularly double exclaves inside Eiskeller, and better placement of Nuthe Wiese) came from [OpenHistoricalMap](https://www.openhistoricalmap.org/changeset/20570#map=10/52.5726/13.3800&layers=O&date=1925-10-06&daterange=1825-01-01,2025-12-31) .
Some exclaves were traced from [a 1967 CIA map (PDF)](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP84-00825R000100670001-2.pdf). A third BÃ¶ttcherberg parcel was found on an Internet Archive scan of a blog post ([this image](https://web.archive.org/web/20100131175330if_/http://strangemaps.files.wordpress.com/2007/05/book_bottcherberg_overlayed1.jpg)).
